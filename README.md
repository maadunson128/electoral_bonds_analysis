# Electoral Bonds Analysis

I am going to do a Analysis on the data related to Electoral Bonds released by SBI on the advise of Supreme Court on March 2024.

The entire flow will added below as my progress continues.


## Overall Flow

### 1. Knowledge about the Electoral bonds
Listened to some podcasts related to Electoral bonds and some articles on this topic.


### 2. Downloading data
Downloaded the 2 PDF's released by SBI from the following link: 
https://www.eci.gov.in/disclosure-of-electoral-bonds

It will be located in the data folder in this repo.


### 3. Manual Overview
Overviewed the data in each PDF's and understood the meaning of the columns.

### 4. Converting the PDF's into suitable data format
I thought of two data formats(csv, xlsx) to convert the data in PDF.
I converted the PDF's to csv using online websites but the output format wasn't not satisfied.
I tried to something with the csv file where its format was not satisfied. It made me took many hours ended to give up.
Then searched for any PDF related libraries in python to modify the PDF's to csv. I came up with library 'tabulu-py' which can be useful with tabular PDF.
I will try the library and update the flow.
